    Â· client asks for id, server returns the resource and all resources that are in the reference chain, if the path gets to a resource already on the list passes to the next
    |- maybe have a depth limit
    |- the server returns a json with all resources, client assembles it (JSON is not built to make graphs, so this has to be the way, the client then assembles the map)
      |- For implementation, back will have the JSON to send and a list of {id + documentVersion} of the resources already on the JSON so as to not duplicate data
