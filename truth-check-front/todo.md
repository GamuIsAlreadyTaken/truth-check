## To avoid headaches
- Don't use ids in components

## External libraries
- Ace editor, for code hightlight
- GunJs, for sharing games

## For future Dev
- Backend on {DenoDeploy} and Frontend on {Vercel} all in a same repo
- Resoruces:
  - are json
  - a resource can be executed
  - in a route like /play/:id
  - '$' porperties for diferent events
  - properties can be auto generated on the resourceCretator
  - when a resource is executed it can be shared with other people
    - the resource is distributed to everyone and then executed
    - the device that shared the resource has the first turn(in the sense of executing first)
    - to comunicate between the devices they use the shared resource(pushing changes to it and reading them)
  - data can have special entries denoted by $
  - entries begining with $ are reserved and can be auto generated by resourceCreator
  - when a resource is executed it has acces to:
    - Cache, (by default it saves everything it references recursively)
  - On creation of a resource all its references are stored on $dependencies, in game that gets converted recursively into all depended resources and the references of those ones (bulk)
- Resource creator:
  - must be easy to use (for non programmers) but let access to all the resource complexity (as in geometric dash level builder, not like portal's one)
## Ideas
- DinamicSlot component, this binding + slot props
